CAreTaker Project

The prevalence of Alzheimer’s and dementia underscores the critical need for innovative solutions to support affected individuals in their daily lives. 
In this project, we introduce CAreTaker, an LLM based virtual assistant designed specifically for individuals grappling with these cognitive challenges. 
Leveraging state-of-the-art Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), CAreTaker offers three features 
i) personalized emotional support, 
ii) aids in daily tasks, and 
iii) provides emergency assistance. 
We offer a user-friendly mobile application interface that allows seamless interaction with our virtual assistant. 
Users benefit from its adaptive capabilities, enabling personalized experiences tailored to their needs and preferences. 
Evaluation studies demonstrate the application’s effectiveness in enhancing user experience and satisfaction. 
While CAreTaker exhibits promising performance, further enhancements and integrations with IoT devices are envisioned for future iterations. 
The aim of the CAreTaker application is to provide a significant step forward in leveraging LLMs to improve the quality of life for individuals with Alzheimer’s and dementia.
